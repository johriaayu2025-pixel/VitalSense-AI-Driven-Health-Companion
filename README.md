# **Submission Details**

## **1. Problem Statement**
Modern healthcare apps are fragmented—users rely on multiple platforms for vitals, diet tracking, medical reports, medications, appointments, and emergency safety. This lack of integration leads to missed health risks, poor compliance, delayed care, and unsafe emergency responses. There is a need for a unified, intelligent, real-time AI-powered platform that proactively monitors health, predicts risks, and assists users with actionable insights.
